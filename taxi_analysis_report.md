# üöï Taxi Trip Pattern Analysis Report: Chicago and San Francisco (2024)

## üìä Executive Summary
This report analyzes taxi trip patterns in Chicago and San Francisco using DBSCAN clustering and spatio-temporal analysis. The analysis focuses on identifying hotspots, temporal patterns, and cross-city comparisons to understand urban mobility patterns in these major metropolitan areas.

## üåÜ Chicago Analysis

### üó∫Ô∏è Spatial Patterns
1. **Pickup Hotspots**
   - Downtown/Loop area shows the highest concentration of pickups
   - O'Hare International Airport forms a distinct cluster
   - Secondary clusters appear around major entertainment districts and transportation hubs

2. **Dropoff Patterns**
   - Similar to pickup patterns but with more dispersion
   - Business districts show peak activity during evening hours
   - Airport dropoffs form stable clusters throughout the day

3. **Temporal Distribution**
   - Peak Hours: 7-9 AM and 4-7 PM (weekdays)
   - Highest activity in Summer and Fall
   - Morning rush shows more concentrated patterns than evening rush

## üåâ San Francisco Analysis

### üó∫Ô∏è Spatial Patterns
1. **Pickup Hotspots**
   - Financial District and SoMa show highest density
   - SFO Airport forms a significant cluster
   - Tourist areas (Fisherman's Wharf, Union Square) show consistent activity

2. **Dropoff Patterns**
   - More dispersed than pickups, especially in residential areas
   - Strong clusters in entertainment districts during evening hours
   - Notable patterns around tech company campuses

3. **Temporal Distribution**
   - Peak Hours: 8-10 AM and 5-8 PM
   - More consistent activity throughout the year
   - Weekend patterns differ significantly from weekdays

## üîÑ Cross-City Comparison

### Common Patterns
1. **Airport Traffic**
   - Both O'Hare and SFO show similar daily patterns
   - Early morning and late evening peaks
   - Consistent weekend activity

2. **Business District Dynamics**
   - Morning peaks are more pronounced in Chicago
   - San Francisco shows more sustained midday activity
   - Both cities show strong evening rush patterns

3. **Seasonal Variations**
   - Chicago shows more seasonal variation
   - San Francisco maintains more consistent patterns year-round
   - Weather impacts are more noticeable in Chicago

### Key Differences
1. **Spatial Distribution**
   - Chicago shows more centralized patterns
   - San Francisco has more distributed hotspots
   - Geographic constraints influence pattern differences

2. **Temporal Patterns**
